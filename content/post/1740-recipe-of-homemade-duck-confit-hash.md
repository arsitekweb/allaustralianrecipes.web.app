Gary Danko, San Francisco demonstrates his recipe for Duck Confit and Potato Hash using russet potatoes, duck leg confit, onions and parsley. Duck confit (French: confit de canard [kɔ̃.fi d(ə) ka.naʁ]) is a French dish made with the whole duck. In Gascony, according to the families perpetuating the tradition of duck confit, all the pieces of duck are used to produce the meal.
