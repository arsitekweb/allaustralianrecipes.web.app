Chinese vegetables can generally be broken into three groups: those easy to grow in temperate regions with cool and cold winters, those that require higher temperatures and long-growing seasons-sub-tropical plants, and, finally, a small group of water vegetables, tubers, and herbs.

Cold weather crops, the use of hoop houses and other methods that extend the natural growing season, and old-fashioned storage vegetables like cabbages and potatoes, all mean that there are plenty of winter fruits and vegetables to choose from across most of the country.
