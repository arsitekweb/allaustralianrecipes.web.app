I always intended adding a caramel topping to that. You could add chopped pecans or walnuts to this recipe if desired, a couple. However, after settling into our new home in Basel, Switzerland last March, Vicky, on account of the cost of dining out and a growing interest in food, started cooking. After a rainy weekend reading David and Stephen&#39;s bright yellow book, The Happy Pear - Recipes and Stories from the Last Ten Years, Vicky quickly became a zealous follower.
