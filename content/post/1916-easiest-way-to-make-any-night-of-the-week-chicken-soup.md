Remove and discard parsley stems and bouquet garni. The keys to this amazing chicken matzo ball soup are slow-cooking it and using boxed matzo ball mix. Some people swear by seltzer, but I find it&#39;s not necessary—the mix makes perfect, fluffy matzo balls every time due to its baking powder. Place all ingredients but the pepper into a pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.
