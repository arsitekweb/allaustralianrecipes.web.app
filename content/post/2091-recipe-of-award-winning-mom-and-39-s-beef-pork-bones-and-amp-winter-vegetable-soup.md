In this recipe, they are seared before getting braised low and slow in a mix of beef stock, red wine, and tomato paste. We did not have any stew meat but did have a ham bone left over so used that instead. Because we didn&#39;t need to cook the ham it did not take as long to cook as the original recipe.. I think an extra package of black-eyed peas could be added since this is called Mom&#39;s Black-Eyed Peas&#34; and not &#34;Mom&#39;s Beef with Black-Eyed Peas&#34;..
