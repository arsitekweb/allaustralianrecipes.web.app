I love curry flavor, like many Irish people. A teaspoon of mild curry powder, a hint of ginger and black pepper create a mildly spicy flavor level, but rest assured, this isn&#39;t an overly. Remove soup from heat and puree in the pot with an immersible blender, or, puree soup in a blender in small batches. Return soup pot to medium-low heat. Some may say it&#39;s too hot to have soup in the summer.
