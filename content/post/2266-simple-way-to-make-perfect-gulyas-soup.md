In Germany, as in many other nations, you don&#39;t find salt and pepper on the table. What you do find is Maggi seasoning, which is. In Austria, warming bowls of goulash soup are served in all kinds of establishments â€” from quick-service restaurants along the Autobahn to Vienna&#39;s elegant Hotel Bristol. True authentic Hungarian goulash is very different! Now, my Mom never called this Goulash.
