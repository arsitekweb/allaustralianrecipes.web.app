recipeingredient:
- "1 kg beef mince"
- "4 large onions chopped"
- "5 carrots diced"
- "1-1 1/2 litres beef stock Oxo cubes can be used"
- "2 kg potatoes"
- "4 heaped tbs beef gravy granules"
- "2 parsnips diced optional"
- " Butter"
- " Milk or cream"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pre-heat oven to Gas Mark 5 or electric equivalent (160C on my Circotherm oven"
- "Put the mince, onions, carrots and (if wished) parsnips into a large casserole"
- "Add the stock or Oxo mix to the casserole, pouring to cover all areas. Stir."
- "Cover with a tight-fitting lid and place in pre-heated oven for 90 minutes."
- "Check once or twice to ensure enough liquid. Add a little stock or boiling water if needed but don’t overdo this!"
- "Towards the end of this cooking phase, peel and boil the potatoes."
- "Mash the potatoes, using a generous amount of butter and just enough milk or cream to allow the stiff mash to spread"
- "Once the meat is cooked, remove from oven and thicken with the gravy granules, stirring thoroughly. You want a firmish, not liquid-y mixture. Leave the oven on."
- "Put half of the casserole’s contents into another, smaller if possible, casserole."
- "Put the second half of the contents into another smaller casserole or leave in the original casserole according to preference."
- "Taste the “brew” and season to taste."
- "Add a thick layer of the potato mash to each casserole and run the back of a fork across the top, so that the times make ridges in the potato topping."
- "Add any desired garnish to the top of the potato layer."
- "Return one of the smaller casseroles to the oven for 35-40 minutes, slightly longer if you prefer the potato topping particularly crisped."
- "Serve piping hot with vegetables of your choice. I like a generous portion of savoy cabbage but other brassicas or most legumes work well. It’s nourishing comfort food, so have what you like!"
- "Let the second casserole cool and put into the freezer for future use or into the fridge if eating the following day."
