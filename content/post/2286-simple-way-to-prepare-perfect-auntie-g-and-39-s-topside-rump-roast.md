Now you have the delicious recipe for our favorite dish! —Linda Gaido, New Brighton, Pennsylvania By tweaking the recipe a bit, I ended up with a rump roast that was super moist and wonderfully tender. Cutting the leftover roast into paper-thin slices will be perfect for sandwiches like roast beef sandwiches with Swiss cheese, in a panini, or as an open-faced sandwich with leftover gravy. Beef on the bone is great as the bone acts as a conductor of heat and gives the roast extra flavour. The eye of the rump is also has its fans, but it must be well aged and from a good source. Topside and silverside are some of the most widely available cuts of beef for roasting.
