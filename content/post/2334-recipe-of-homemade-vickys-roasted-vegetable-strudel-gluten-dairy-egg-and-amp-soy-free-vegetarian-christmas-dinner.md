Aimee Ryan&#39;s vegan vegetable strudel recipe makes a sublime vegan roast dinner option. Comforting portobello mushrooms and butter beans form the base of this dish, while golden filo pastry provides a pleasing crunch. To assemble the strudel: Drizzle the strudel with butter (don&#39;t brush it on; you may tear the dough) and top with bread crumbs, as directed in your choice of the recipes listed in &#34;tips,&#34; below. Working with one of the shorter sides, gently grab the dough and roll it up into a tight spiral. While most people tend to think &#34;apple strudel,&#34; strudels can be sweet or savory.
