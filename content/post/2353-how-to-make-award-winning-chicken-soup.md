1. Chicken soup freezes well and you should always have some to hand in case of plague, famine or invasion.


Remove and discard parsley stems and bouquet garni. The keys to this amazing chicken matzo ball soup are slow-cooking it and using boxed matzo ball mix. Some people swear by seltzer, but I find it&#39;s not necessary—the mix makes perfect, fluffy matzo balls every time due to its baking powder. Place all ingredients but the pepper into a pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.
