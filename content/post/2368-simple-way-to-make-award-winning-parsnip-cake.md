A new take on carrot cake. In fact, this is very much like a carrot cake—complete with cream cheese frosting—and if you wanted to swap the sweet, earthy parsnips for sweet, earthy carrots, or combine the two, that would be fine. The cake is double-filled—it gets a layer of cream cheese frosting and then one of gingered-cranberry jam, made lickety-split. Dorie Greenspan&#39;s Triple-Layer Parsnip and Cranberry Cake.

One of my best days of filming season four of Weekends with Yankee was spent in the Connecticut kitchen of beloved cookbook author Dorie Greenspan. And when I say &#34;beloved,&#34; I&#39;m not exaggerating: There&#39;s a whole section of Instagram, not to mention the blogosphere, devoted to cooking recipes from her. This takes spice cake to a whole new level. It&#39;s amped up with parsnips and fresh ginger and balanced with the most perfect sweet-and-nutty, browned butter frosting. In a large bowl sift together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and mixed spice.
