recipeinstructions:

- "peel potatoes, carrots and parsnips and cut into 1 in pieces.  Chop celery and onion into 1/2 in pieces. Put all veggies into 12 quart roasting pan, preferably one with a good fitting lid.  (I use my enamel coated roasting pan with the lid, got it at k-mart not too expensive and it cleans up really well). Cover veggies with cold water just enough so they are all under the water, this will prevent browning while you are prepping the rest of the stew."

- "Reduce the heat on the skillet to medium, deglaze the pan with the red wine, scraping the bits off the bottom of the pan with a metal whisk.  Add the butter and flour, whisk until it forms a rue, allow to cook for 2-3 min, whisking often.  Add beef stock a little at a time, whisking contstantly to remove any lumps.  Allow to cook in the skillet until it thickens into a gravy, add salt and pepper to taste."
- "Add gravy to the roasting pan with the veggies and water and mix gently. Add beef and all the juices that have run into the plate to the roasting pan.  Stir to mix, add bay leaves and rosemary sprigs, cover with the lid or loosely with aluminum foil.  Place in oven for 2 1/2 -3 hours or until carrots and potatoes are cooked through.  Stir occasionally throught cooking."
- "Once potatoes and carrots are cooked through remove from oven and remove the bay leaves and rosemary sprigs. Stir in the garlic salt."
- "Serve with good crusty bread, I like a good roasted garlic or rosemary ciabatta.  A sour dough loaf goes well too. Enjoy!!!!!"
- "Extras:  -if you want a thicker, richer broth double the butter and flour you use to make the rue and cook rue slightly longer -you can use different veggies such as winter squash, turnip, sweet potatoes, etc.  just keep in mind that the different veggies will add their own unique twist in the overal flavor of your stew."
