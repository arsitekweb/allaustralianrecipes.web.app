recipeinstructions:
- "Note by Judith Choate:  &#34;I use as many different vegetables as I can in this, but if you&#39;re limited to only two or three, make sure that you include eggplant and carrots, sweet potato or wintersquash.  This will balance the texture moisture and taste if the pie, which is also a terrific dish for those on salt free diets.  I like it lightly seasoned, but you can reduce the spiciness by eliminating the hot prettier flakes and adding just a drop of Tobasco  sauce.&#34;"
