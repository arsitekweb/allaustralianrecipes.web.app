The sauce that goes over the chicken before you place it in the oven is a mixture of honey, garlic and some herbs. I think I could eat it by the spoonful, it is that good. Oyster Mushrooms: Oyster mushrooms have a distinct shape and texture that makes them a great substitute for meat.; Buttermilk: Buttermilk is used to tenderize the meat in traditional fried chicken recipes. We&#39;ll use it for it&#39;s flavor to help mimic fried chicken!
