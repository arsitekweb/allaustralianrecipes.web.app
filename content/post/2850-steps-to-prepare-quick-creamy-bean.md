Everything you need to make this humble-but-satisfying meal is probably in your kitchen at this very moment Two cans of beans (chickpeas and white beans) are simmered with milk, a whole head of garlic, herbs and nutmeg for a rich and creamy vegetarian dinner that can be on the table in under a half-hour Be sure to use whole milk here — it&#39;s the most flavorful and will yield the best results Soak the beans in a pot of water overnight. Heat the olive oil in the pot over medium heat. Nice way to mix up green beans I was tired of steamed or roasted green beans so I began searching for a healthy alternative.

##### The ingredients needed to make Creamy bean:

1. Get 1 bag frozen green fava beans
1. Get 1 pound chopped lamb shanks

Rinse the beans and place them in the slow cooker. Add the garlic, onion, salt, pepper, ham and the pinch of ground cloves. Pour in the water and broth. And convenient: Beans go in dry--no need to soak. Using the bacon fat and garlic to saute the green beans before semi steaming/braising the beans in chicken broth guarantees flavour even before we get to the creamy paremsan sauce!
