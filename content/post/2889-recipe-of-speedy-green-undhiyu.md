Undhiyu is a Gujarati mixed vegetable dish that is a regional specialty of Surat, India. The name of this dish comes from the Gujarati word &#34;undhu&#34;, which translates to upside down, since the dish is traditionally cooked upside down underground in earthen pots, termed &#34;matlu&#34;. Undhiyu is specially made in winter as some veggies used for making are only available in winter. You can also add green peas if you wish to.
