- "Pass the soup through a sieve or conical strainer, check the seasoning and keep soup hot, if its a bit thick you can add a little water. In this video I&#39;ve garnished with a poached quail egg, I simmered for 1 minute, blanche the peeled broad beans for 1 minute then spoon into the centre of a bowl, pour soup around the beans."
- "I finished my dish with some double cream and the quail egg which I nip with a small knife to allow the soft yolk to ooze out. A further garnish was a parmesan crisp which I demonstrated in my last recipe. These garnishes are all nice but not essential why not just try this soup on its own, its lovely?
