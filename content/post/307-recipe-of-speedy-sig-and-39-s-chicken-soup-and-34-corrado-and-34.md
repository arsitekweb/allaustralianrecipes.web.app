recipeinstructions:
- "Either use small chicken or use the chicken pieces, add them into large pan."
- "Keep the onions whole and unpeeled, cut a large cross into each stem. Add the onions, carrots, crushed garlic, celery, parsnip, turmeric, salt and black pepper, add half the dill, cover with water. Cover pot with lid and bring to boil, instantly turn heat down to simmer."

I cool the soup down until the layer of fat becomes solid and I remove most of it that way. You do not need to discard this but can use it for frying if you like."
- "Chop the celery greens, add to soup. Remove the chicken. Take skin of chicken (you can fry this and then crumble it into soup as garnish) take meat of the bones, put it back into soup. Discard bones."
- "Cut up one of the onions and add to soup if you like. Serve with the Matzo dumpling or add rice or noodles and add rest of dill if needed.Great homemade soup"
