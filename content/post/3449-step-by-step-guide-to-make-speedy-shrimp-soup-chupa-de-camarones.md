Be sure to buy un-peeled shrimp. You start by making a sofrito and end with a broth that is incredible in its depth of flavor. Let your food processor do the mincing. Where you see shrimp soup listed in the ingredients know that I use cubes of Knorr Sopa de Camaron that are about a Tbsp. For some reason the Recipe Tsar won&#39;t let me use the term.
