A savory stew with apple, red potatoes, onion and seasoning. This is a very easy, tasty chicken dish I concocted when I was trying to think of a dish like pot roast yet using chicken rather than beef. With crusty French bread made a wonderful meal for a cold evening and will definitely make it again. This braised chicken stew starts and ends with bacon (plus a whole lotta goodness in between) and I&#39;m particularly obsessed with the applewood bacon I get from a nearby butcher.
