Potato leek soup, or potage parmentier, is a French classic. It&#39;s one of the first dishes I learned to make in culinary school, right after a proper omelet, because it&#39;s an essential base soup in French cuisine. Add watercress for potage au cresson, serve it chilled for Vichyssoise â€” or top it with bacon. Combine potatoes, leeks, parsnip, celery and leaves, garlic, pepper and chicken broth in large saucepan or stew pot.

Return soup to the stove and, on low heat add fresh thyme, heavy cream and Parmesan Cheese. Stir constantly until soup is hot and cheese has thoroughly melted. Use the leeks, garlic, potatoes, and spinach from your CSA (community-supported agriculture) box to make this creamy seasonal soup. Scoop about half the potatoes, leeks, and garlic into a food processor bowl with enough liquid to cover; process until pureed. Working in batches, puree soup in a blender.
