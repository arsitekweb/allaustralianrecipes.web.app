- "2 parsnips depends a bit on the size"
- "5 carrots"
- " sesame oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the vegetables. Cut the parsnips and carrots into fries. The thinner you cut the fries the crispier they&#39;ll be. Separate the florets from the broccoli stalk and cut the stalk into pieces."
- "For the broccoli mash: put the broccoli in a pan full of water and bring to a boil. cook until soft enough to mash. Drain the water, mash the broccoli, add a tiny bit of olive oil (for both the texture and the taste) and season with pepper and salt."
- "For the parsnip/carrot fries: put the fries in a bowl and apply some sesame oil. Put them in an air fryer or in a 200°C degrees oven for about 15 to twenty minutes (or until they&#39;re as crispy as you like)."
- "For the steaks: season the steaks just before adding them to a frying pan. Cook according to taste. I personally like about 3 minutes either side on high heat."
- "Add everything together on a nice plate."
