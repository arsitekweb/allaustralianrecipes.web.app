I am not growing broad beans this year - not too late yet!! c Salmon Bean Salad [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] Beans salads aren&#39;t incompatible with green salads, as this recipe, combining plump cranberry beans and peppery arugula, demonstrates. Salmon fillet, poached with a few aromatics, turns the dish into a meal. For salmon that&#39;s especially juicy and tender, we&#39;ve found that cold-start poaching works best. Toast the almonds in a dry griddle pan on a medium heat until lightly golden, tossing regularly, then remove and finely slice. To make the vinaigrette, whisk the white wine vinegar and olive oil together with some seasoning, then set aside.
