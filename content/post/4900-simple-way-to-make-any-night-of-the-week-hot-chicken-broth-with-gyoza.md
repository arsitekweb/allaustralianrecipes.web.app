So, basically, very delicious, carefully breaded chickens full of flavor. Apparently it is available in SOME restaurants in the States, and is provided by a select supplier. Generally there are two types of broth for hot pot, one is spicy version (红汤 in Chinese ) and the other is clear (清汤 in Chinese)version. Broth is made with uncooked bones (like when I spatchcock my thanksgiving turkey and take out the backbone before cooking it!), and stock is made from cooked bones (think you just made a rotisserie chicken, then you strip all the meat off and save the bones to make stock.) Thai chicken &amp; mushroom broth. Stir in the chicken and most of the spring onion greens to gently heat through, then serve ladled into bowls and scattered with the remaining lime zest.
