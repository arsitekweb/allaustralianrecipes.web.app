- "Add the lettuce and cook for a couple of minutes only so that it keeps its crunch."
- "Mix in the white wine and remove from the heat (so that the wine doesn&#39;t leave an acidic taste). Roughly chop the ricotta."
- "Cook the pasta al dente or a minute under, drain it and add it to the pan. Switch the heat to high and toss for a minute or two until fully mixed."
- "Divide into the serving plates, spread the ricotta on top and grind some pepper. You can sprinkle with olive oil or even lemon zest if you like it."
- "Buon appetito!"
