Vegetarian and dairy free, this dish will fill you up. Besides it&#39;s massive yumminess level, I love risotto for how easy it is. Asides from heating the broth up in a separate saucepan, everything is cooked in one big. The broad beans are really just a finishing flourish, an extra scattering of green. Feel free to stick to peas on their own.
