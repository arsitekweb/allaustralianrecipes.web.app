Try this slow-cooked stew recipe with spicy sausage, chestnut mushrooms and flageolet beans in a rich tomato sauce. Top tip for making Sausage, mushroom and bean stew. If the stew is very thick add some extra boiling water or stock. Borlotti Beans are my favourite tinned bean - hearty and flavoursome. But any type of tinned bean will work well here so don&#39;t fret or make a special journey to get them - canellini beans, kidney beans or even butter beans would be lovely here too.
