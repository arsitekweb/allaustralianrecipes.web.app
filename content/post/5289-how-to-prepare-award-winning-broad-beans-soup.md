Bessara is a humble but delicious Moroccan dish of pureed beans which can be found as street food and homemade comfort food. Made from either dried split peas or dried fava beans (ful in Arabic), it&#39;s seasoned to taste with garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil and presented in pureed form with cumin, paprika, and sometimes olive oil and harissa on the side as condiments. Return the soup to the pot, and add the remaining fava beans. If the soup is too thick, add some the remaining stock to adjust the consistency. Taste the soup to check the seasoning and reseason.
