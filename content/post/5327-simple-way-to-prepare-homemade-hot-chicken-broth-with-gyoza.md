Generally there are two types of broth for hot pot, one is spicy version (红汤 in Chinese ) and the other is clear (清汤 in Chinese)version. Broth is made with uncooked bones (like when I spatchcock my thanksgiving turkey and take out the backbone before cooking it!), and stock is made from cooked bones (think you just made a rotisserie chicken, then you strip all the meat off and save the bones to make stock.)
