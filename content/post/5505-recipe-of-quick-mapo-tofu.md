It consists of tofu set in a spicy sauce, typically a thin, oily, and bright red suspension, based on douban (fermented broad bean and chili paste) and douchi (fermented black beans), along with minced meat, traditionally beef. Variations exist with other ingredients such as water. Mapo Tofu is a classic Szechuan dish that features tofu covered in spices and minced meat. It pairs extremely well with rice, and may even be necessary with how spicy it can get.

The name literally translates to &#34;pockmarked old lady tofu&#34;, inspired by the old lady that made this dish. Mapo Tofu is a popular Chinese dish from Sichuan Province, where spicy food is king and the signature spice of the region--the Sichuan Peppercorn--gives dishes a unique &#34;numbing&#34; effect. It&#39;s almost like the Sichuan peppercorns are there to not only add their fragrance and flavor, but also to numb your tongue so it can take more heat! Combine marinade ingredients in a bowl. Combine sauce ingredients in a bowl; set aside.
