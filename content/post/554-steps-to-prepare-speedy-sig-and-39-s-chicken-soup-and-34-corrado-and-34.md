recipeinstructions:
- "Either use small chicken or use the chicken pieces, add them into large pan."
- "Keep the onions whole and unpeeled, cut a large cross into each stem. Add the onions, carrots, crushed garlic, celery, parsnip, turmeric, salt and black pepper, add half the dill, cover with water. Cover pot with lid and bring to boil, instantly turn heat down to simmer."

I cool the soup down until the layer of fat becomes solid and I remove most of it that way. You do not need to discard this but can use it for frying if you like."
