Fried Halloumi Appetizer: Brush halloumi cheese slices with olive oil and pan-fry for one to two minutes on each side. Plate the cheese along with grape tomato halves; then drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with pepper and oregano. Grilled Halloumi: Cube the cheese and thread it onto bamboo skewers that have been soaked in water. Its texture is similar to that of mozzarella or thick feta, except that it has a strong, salty flavour imbibed from the brine preserve. Cooking the Halloumi removes all its saltiness and empowers it with a creamy texture.
