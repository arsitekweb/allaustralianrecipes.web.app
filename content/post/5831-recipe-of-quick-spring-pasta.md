Giada&#39;s yummy pasta is the perfect dish for a warm spring night. After tossing the spaghetti with shrimp and a lemon dressing, add fried capers for a crisp, flavor-packed bite. The picture looked so enticing and the ingredients good for a spring pasta. But the result, though nice to look at, was uninspring, bland and somewhat viscous. I followed the recipe as written except for using vegetable broth instead of chicken.
