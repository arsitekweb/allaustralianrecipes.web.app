Sprouted Kitchen At work, I have a straight-shot view from my sample corner to the front of the store. Grano Padano and Parmigiano-Reggiano are both northern Italian cheeses originally made by monks, and both come in different lengths of aging. In Italian, Grana is the word for grain, and it&#39;s actually the word for a type of cheese whose tiny crags and crannies look a little like specks of grain, he says. Eat Parmigiano Reggiano as is for a snack, an aperitif or for a quick dinner, or pair it with some special ingredients and make a real magic! Parmigiano Reggiano cheese or Parmesan is affectionately known as the king of all Italian cheeses, undoubtedly thanks to its stately appearance and full flavor.
