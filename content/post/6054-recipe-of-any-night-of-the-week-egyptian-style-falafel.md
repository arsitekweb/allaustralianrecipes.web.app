Falafel makes for a great plant-based protein source, especially important for for vegetarians and vegans. So far, though, the only falafel I seemed to find was the Palestinian/Israeli version. I have yet to find a falafel cart/stand/joint that makes Egyptian-style falafel. Maybe it has something to do with the aversion some of us have to the mention of fava beans.
