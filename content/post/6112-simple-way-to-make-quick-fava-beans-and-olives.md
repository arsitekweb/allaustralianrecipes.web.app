Hey everyone, it is me, Dave, welcome to our recipe page. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, fava beans and olives. One of my favorites food recipes. This time, I will make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Fava Beans and Olives is one of the most well liked of current trending foods in the world. It's appreciated by millions every day. It's simple, it is fast, it tastes delicious. Fava Beans and Olives is something that I have loved my entire life. They are nice and they look fantastic.

The meaty Spanish olives and nutty fava beans are a great combination. Anchovies and chilli amplify the iron-y flavour of the beans. Lettuce and ricotta balance it out.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can have fava beans and olives using 5 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Fava Beans and Olives:

1. Take 1 cup prepared* fresh fava beans
1. Take 1 cup green olives
1. Get 1 cup black olives
1. Prepare 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1. Make ready 1 clove garlic


Serve it as a bean stew or mash up the beans and use it as a high octane dip. SERVE over rice with crumbled feta cheese on top (alternatively serve with bulgur or crusty bread instead of rice). Fava beans are encased in a shell that&#39;s usually removed before cooking or eating—here in the U. S. and in France—but not in other areas where fava beans are widely consumed.

It&#39;s difficult to find dried fava beans in Central Florida, but I did find them plus dried lupini beans at the Portuguese Corner Store and Bakery in Palm Bay. Frozen fava beans are very different from the dried, you may want to use a different recipe for the frozen, to enjoy their texture and flavor. PLACE the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper in a jar with a screw-top lid and shake to combine. MIX together the prepared bulgur and fava beans, tomatoes, olives, scallions, feta, parsley and mint in a bowl. DRIZZLE in the dressing and toss gently to combine well.
