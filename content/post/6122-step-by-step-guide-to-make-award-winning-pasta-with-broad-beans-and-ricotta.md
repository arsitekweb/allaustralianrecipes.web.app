recipeinstructions:
- "Remove the beans from their fluffy pods. These ones are quite small, so I used them straight away, but if they have a tough skin you can boil them for 2-3 minutes and then peel them. That&#39;s a bit of work though..."
- "Chop the onions and chilli finely. Heat two tablespoons of olive oil in a large non-stick pan and add half a teaspoon of salt (helps to keep the veggies crispy). Add the chopped onions, chilli and the anchovies."
- "Fry for five minutes or so until golden and the anchovies have melted into a paste. Take care not to burn the onions!"
- "Add the broad beans and cover with a lid. Cook for ten minutes on low heat, stirring often. in the meantime, chop the lettuce coarsely and start cooking the pasta in boiling water."
- "Add the lettuce and cook for a couple of minutes only so that it keeps its crunch."
- "Mix in the white wine and remove from the heat (so that the wine doesn&#39;t leave an acidic taste). Roughly chop the ricotta."
- "Cook the pasta al dente or a minute under, drain it and add it to the pan. Switch the heat to high and toss for a minute or two until fully mixed."
- "Divide into the serving plates, spread the ricotta on top and grind some pepper. You can sprinkle with olive oil or even lemon zest if you like it."
- "Buon appetito!"

I bought some organic broad beans at my local farmers market and I made a pasta dish adding ricotta, prosciutto and fennel seeds for a delicate and interesting flowery taste. You can check my broad beans salad recipe where you can see how to prepare these beans. Cooking time for the beans depends largely on their size. Cook the frozen beans, either on the hob or in the microwave, again according to the instructions on the packet, and drain. Take the frying pan off the heat and add the broad beans, the ricotta, about half the pecorino, the dried mint and the pepper.
