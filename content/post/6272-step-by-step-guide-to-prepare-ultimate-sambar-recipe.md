There are many varieties of sambar that are prepared using different vegetables and spices, and each one of it has a unique taste and flavor. The one I relish the most is the mullangi sambar (radish sambar) and tiffin sambar. Below I have shared a simple version of vegetable sambar that I make a lot. Otherwise, cook separately gives the best result in taste. Additionally, you can add store-bought sambar powder in the recipe but freshly prepared sambar paste gives more richness and tasty flavor in the sambar recipe.
