Budhiya Ki Kachori at Ravinder gate has people waiting every morning for their share of Kaddu Ki Sabzi and deep fried kachoris served with jalebis. Toss your weight concerns aside and bite into this pure desi Banarasi breakfast. (Pro tip: Don&#39;t count calories!) Banarasi Paan: Actually cooking even plain boiled rice is a skill that one needs to learn as this is one of the most basic kitchen skill that many ignore. So when all the main dishes are cooked well and the rice turns up either too hard or too mushy, it spoils the whole meal in my opinion. The blog Banras ka khana is basically about traditional, heirloom recipes belonging to Eastern UP and neighboring areas. Being a hardcore supporter of indigenous recipes and local ingredients, I love cooking and sharing some traditional recipes from other states of India too and a few old traditional recipes from other parts of the world too.
