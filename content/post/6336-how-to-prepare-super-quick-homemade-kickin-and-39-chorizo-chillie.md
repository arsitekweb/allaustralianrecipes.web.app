Heat slow cooker on low setting. So last night I decided to make this great sounding chili recipe I got off of the Craigslist message board for Chicken and Chorizo Chili. It sounded great, but the fact that part of the directions read &#34;throw all the shit in the pan and cook it&#34; should have been the first sign that the person who posted it was not the most meticulous recipe writer. Chicken Chorizo Chili makes one of the best chorizo chili recipes with tender chunks of chicken, a spicy red sauce, beans and secret ingredient spices.
