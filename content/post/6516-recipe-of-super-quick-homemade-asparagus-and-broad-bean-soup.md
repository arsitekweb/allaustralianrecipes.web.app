- "Pass the soup through a sieve or conical strainer, check the seasoning and keep soup hot, if its a bit thick you can add a little water. In this video I&#39;ve garnished with a poached quail egg, I simmered for 1 minute, blanche the peeled broad beans for 1 minute then spoon into the centre of a bowl, pour soup around the beans."
- "I finished my dish with some double cream and the quail egg which I nip with a small knife to allow the soft yolk to ooze out. A further garnish was a parmesan crisp which I demonstrated in my last recipe. These garnishes are all nice but not essential why not just try this soup on its own, its lovely?

Pod the broad beans and boil them in deep, lightly salted water. Fond childhood memories are made of things like this - sitting cross legged on the kitchen floor podding peas and broad beans - one for the pot, two for me, one for the potâ€¦. For the minestrone primavera, blanch the asparagus, peas, broad beans and green beans in a pan of boiling salted water for a few minutes until cooked but with a crunch. Drain and set aside on a tray. To serve, scatter the broad beans over each bowl and top with the garlic-and-chilli oil, pancetta and pecorino.
