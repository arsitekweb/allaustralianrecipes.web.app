It&#39;s difficult to find dried fava beans in Central Florida, but I did find them plus dried lupini beans at the Portuguese Corner Store and Bakery in Palm Bay. Frozen fava beans are very different from the dried, you may want to use a different recipe for the frozen, to enjoy their texture and flavor. PLACE the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper in a jar with a screw-top lid and shake to combine. MIX together the prepared bulgur and fava beans, tomatoes, olives, scallions, feta, parsley and mint in a bowl. DRIZZLE in the dressing and toss gently to combine well.
