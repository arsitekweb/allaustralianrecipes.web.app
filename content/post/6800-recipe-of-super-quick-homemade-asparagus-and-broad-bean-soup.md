- "I finished my dish with some double cream and the quail egg which I nip with a small knife to allow the soft yolk to ooze out. A further garnish was a parmesan crisp which I demonstrated in my last recipe. These garnishes are all nice but not essential why not just try this soup on its own, its lovely?
