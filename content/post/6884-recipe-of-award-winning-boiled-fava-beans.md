Drain fava beans and place in a deep skillet or saucepan. This basic method of cooking fava beans was taught to me by chef Gabriel Claycamp of Culinary Communion. When I was recently able to get ahold of fresh fava beans, I wanted to cook them in a way that highlighted the taste of the beans themselves, and here&#39;s how Gabriel suggested I fix them. To peel the blanched beans, use your thumb to pop open the top of the skin at the bean&#39;s dimple and remove. Once the prep work is out of the way, the beans can be used as is or cooked further, depending on the recipe.
