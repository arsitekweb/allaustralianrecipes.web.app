Khaman is soft, spongy and has a melt in the mouth texture, which is why it is known as nylon khaman. Dhokla can be spongy as well but is a tad bit denser than khaman. Of the two, khaman is more commonly sold in the market and is most often referred to as Dhokla, which, of course, is the wrong name for the dish.
