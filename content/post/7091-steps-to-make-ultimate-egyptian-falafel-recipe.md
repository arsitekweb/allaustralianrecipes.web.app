In my recipe, I used red lentils and replaced the traditional cooking method (frying) with baking. The Egyptian falafel is greener, crispier, and flakier. In Cairo they call it T&#39;aamiya , but if you are in Alexandria they still call it falafel. My dad and his family is from Cairo, and my mother&#39;s side is from Alexandria so we use both names, interchangably.
