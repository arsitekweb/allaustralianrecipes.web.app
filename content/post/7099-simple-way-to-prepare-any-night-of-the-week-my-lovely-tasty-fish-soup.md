Everything is cooked in one pot in Cod is my favorite fish and I buy it often. The dish looks so delicious and it&#39;s definitely tasty. Fish soup, especially the milky white Chinese fish soup, is something I imagine many love but shy away from making at home. The tasty savory sweet broth with a milky smooth feel is something difficult to dislike. But making a good fish broth can seem like a daunting task.
