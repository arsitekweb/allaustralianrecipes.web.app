No one is quite sure how or where Bigilla originated, although there are similar dishes with similar names in countries such as Lebanon and Iraq. Bigilla is a Maltese speciality - a dip that is made out of dried &#39;fava&#39; beans (broad beans). It has just the right amount of chilli peppers added to give it a spicy kick, whilst the mint cools things down a bit, and adds to the special flavour of this deliciously rustic dip and spread. Bigilla is a typical country dish and is one of the mainstays of traditional Maltese cuisine.
