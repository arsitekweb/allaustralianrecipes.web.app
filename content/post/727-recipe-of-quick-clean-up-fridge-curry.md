Heat up the curry then rub a small amount between the tip of your thumb and pointing finger. Obviously you have to take food out of the fridge to clean it. If you don&#39;t have a ton of counter space, consider setting up a little folding table or using a few These cute little desks should provide enough surface area for temporary food storage, among many other uses, and can be folded up and tucked. The time curry lasts in the fridge depends on the kind of gravy.
