Tagine (tay-jean) is the name of savory Moroccan meat or poultry stews as well as the ceramic vessel in which they are cooked. A slow cooker creates the same kind of moist, gentle cooking as the ceramic tagine. This scrumptious Moroccan lamb casserole (or tagine) with apricots and carrots is one of my favourite slow cooker recipes. It&#39;s hearty, rich, nutritious and easy to make and is paleo and gluten-free.
