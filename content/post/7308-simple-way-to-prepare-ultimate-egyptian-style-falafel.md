Hello everybody, it's Drew, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, egyptian style falafel. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I'm gonna make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Egyptian style Falafel is one of the most popular of current trending foods on earth. It is easy, it is fast, it tastes yummy. It is appreciated by millions every day. They are nice and they look fantastic. Egyptian style Falafel is something that I've loved my whole life.

Falafel, or ta&#39;ameya as we call it in Egypt, is an all-time favorite street food. In most parts of the Middle East, falafel is made with ground chickpeas. However, in Egypt, we make it with dried fava beans.


To begin with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can have egyptian style falafel using 6 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Egyptian style Falafel:

1. Prepare 2 cups (300 g) split fava beans
1. Make ready 1 cup finely chopped(dill, parsley and coriander)
1. Prepare 1 large sized onion (or chive) and 4 cloves of garlic
1. Prepare 1 flat tablespoon of salt
1. Get 1 teaspoon black pepper
1. Get 2 teaspoons each (cumin and ground coriander)


Falafel makes for a great plant-based protein source, especially important for for vegetarians and vegans. So far, though, the only falafel I seemed to find was the Palestinian/Israeli version. I have yet to find a falafel cart/stand/joint that makes Egyptian-style falafel. Maybe it has something to do with the aversion some of us have to the mention of fava beans.
