You can use other vegetables like snow pea, onion, celery and bell pepper. Test for doneness by removing noodle from pot, running it under cold water, then biting. Udon shouldn&#39;t be hard in the middle. *I much prefer Soft or Frozen Udon noodles. In this quick and spicy weeknight noodle dish, sizzling hot oil is poured over red-pepper flakes, orange peel, crunchy peanuts, soy sauce and sesame oil. While you brown the ground chicken, the mixture sits, and the flavors become more pronounced and fiery.
