Stir in the olive oil and add lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste. If you&#39;d like a softer texture, use a potato masher to crush a few of the broad beans. Serve on toast with shavings of pecorino or parmesan, or as an accompaniment to lamb, halloumi or fish. I personally prefer the fried beans as they are more similar to the ones I remember, but the baked option is nothing to sneeze at.
