A delicious fish soup that&#39;s low in fat! Having grown up on the Texas/Mexico border, I like foods spicy, but you can adjust the seasonings to taste. I happened to have every single ingredient in the house except for the yogurt, but I made it anyway. Oh my goodness, this soup was WONDERFUL! Fish soup, especially the milky white Chinese fish soup, is something I imagine many love but shy away from making at home.
