- "200 g soaked and boiled dried black beans or just us a tin"
- "200 g soaked and boiled dried brown lentils or just use a tin"

- "In the meantime add one tablespoon of the oil to a frying pan and add the chopped onion and garlic. Sautee until translucent but not brown."
- "Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the walnut and broad bean mixture in the food processor followed by the black beans and lentils, including a little of the water they were cooked in to help the mixture combine. Blitz in the food processor for 1 minute or until roughly combined. You should still see some black beans whole."

- "Repeat till the mixture is done. This should make about 10 patties but depends how much beans and flour you use. Place the baking tray in the oven for 15 minutes, flipping the burgers after 10 minutes so they brown evenly."
