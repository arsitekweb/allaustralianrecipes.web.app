Pureed with flavorful aromatics, white beans shine as a dairy-free hero, delivering creamy, rich body to our vegan Alfredo sauce. Whether you follow a vegan diet, you&#39;ve cut out dairy, or you&#39;re simply looking for a delicious (low-fat) new pasta dish to add into your rotation, you&#39;re going to love this flavorful white bean Alfredo. The nutritional yeast is a key ingredient of the sauce. Using the bacon fat and garlic to saute the green beans before semi steaming/braising the beans in chicken broth guarantees flavour even before we get to the creamy paremsan sauce!
