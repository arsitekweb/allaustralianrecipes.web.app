recipeinstructions:

- "Prepare the veg - Finely dice the onion, crush the garlic, pod the beans, slice the asparagus into 1 inch pieces. Prepare the stock - in my case I boil the kettle and dissolve stock pot in a jug."
- "Take a large pan and add the olive oil over a medium heat. Add the onion and fry gently for a few minutes (don&#39;t let it burn) then add the crushed garlic and rice and stir fry for 1 minute."

- "Spoon the risotto into a pasta bowl, heap the sweet roasted tomatoes on top and then grate on lots of fresh Parmesan. Enjoy!"
