Many of us at Church Lane are currently suffering infestations of this invasive, deep-rooted perennial weed and want to know more about it and how to get rid of it. The bulbs will be ready to harvest next August but if you have plenty and don&#39;t necessarily need all of them the garlic greens (once big enough) can be chopped back to an inch above ground level and used in risotto, stir-fry etc. Each plant should produce at least two cuttings per season and the bulbs can be left in situ as a permanent veg. Flavours straight from the allotment: sweet peas, crunchy courgette, fragrant leek.

We make risotto easy with a brown rice base - yet still rich with silky cashew cream, and a lemony mint and Brazil nut pesto. Toss squash with oil on a large rimmed baking sheet. Beetroot recipes are bursting with colour and flavour, try Jamie&#39;s beetroot salads, soups and dips, there&#39;s even a decadent beetroot cake recipe. All pies are served with mash, spring greens and veggie. Asparagus; If you have plenty of space then why not plant a permanent asparagus bed this autumn.
