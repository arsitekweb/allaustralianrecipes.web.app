The earthy aromas from the casserole of beans, broth, herbs and meat nested beneath a thick crust draws diners together and. Reduce heat to medium and place onion, carrot, and garlic in pot; season with salt and pepper. Remove from the oven, remove the lid and top the cassoulet with sliced tomatoes and the Garlic Bread Crumbs. The first time I had cassoulet in its home turf it was a revelation. This loose, almost soup-like stew of beans and meat was so far removed from all versions of cassoulet I&#39;d had in the United States, or even in other parts of France.
