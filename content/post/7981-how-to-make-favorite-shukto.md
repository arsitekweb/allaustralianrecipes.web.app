Pritha explains, &#34;Shukto is not really the name of a single dish. It is essentially a style and method of cooking a starter which is a jewel in the crown of Bengali cuisine. Shukto which people from opar bangla or Bangladesh call shuktoni is actually the result of Portuguese influence from colonization in the pre British era when the use of milk in a savory vegetable dish was tried. The fried lentil dumplings or bori is another delightful part of Shukto which adds a nice bite to the dish.
