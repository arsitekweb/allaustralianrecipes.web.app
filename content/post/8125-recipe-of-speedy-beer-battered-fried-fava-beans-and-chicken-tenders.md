- "Put 1 cup of store-bought tempura flour into a bowl, pour the beer, add salt and grain mustard, and mix well. Deep-fry the battered onion, fava beans, and chicken tenders in that order in 170℃ oil. (Since the chicken tenders are seasoned with garlic powder, deep-fry at the end, so that the other things won&#39;t absorb the smell)."
