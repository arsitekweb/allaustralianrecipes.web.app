Unlike Persian rice that has to be very fluffy, this one is a bit sticky but tastes fab. A very Persian thing about making steamed rice is covering the bottom of the pot with sliced potatoes, lavash (a kind of flatbread), or even romaine lettuce leaves. But I love me some Fall, and with the Fall it means some heartier foods, and with that I give you Baghali Polow Mahicheh or Lamb Shanks with Herbed Basmati Rice and Fava Beans. This is one of my favorite Persian/Iranian foods. It&#39;s decadent Basmati Rice that is mixed with fresh Persian herbs and fava beans.
