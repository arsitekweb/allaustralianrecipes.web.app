recipeinstructions:

- "Prepare the veg - Finely dice the onion, crush the garlic, pod the beans, slice the asparagus into 1 inch pieces. Prepare the stock - in my case I boil the kettle and dissolve stock pot in a jug."
- "Take a large pan and add the olive oil over a medium heat. Add the onion and fry gently for a few minutes (don&#39;t let it burn) then add the crushed garlic and rice and stir fry for 1 minute."

- "Pour in half the stock, reduce to a simmer and keep stirring every minute. When the risotto starts looking dry add more stock and keep stirring. After about 20 minutes the rice should soften, get a teaspoon and taste. If it&#39;s still uncooked keep adding stock or water until it is nearly perfect."
- "When you are happy that the risotto is nearly perfect add the broad beans and asparagus, mix well and cook for 3-5 minutes. Squeeze in the juice of the lemon and season to taste."
- "Spoon the risotto into a pasta bowl, heap the sweet roasted tomatoes on top and then grate on lots of fresh Parmesan. Enjoy!"
