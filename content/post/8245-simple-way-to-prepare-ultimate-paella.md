Paella is one of the best-known dishes in Spanish cuisine. For this reason, many non-Spaniards view it as Spain&#39;s national dish, but Spaniards almost unanimously consider it to be a dish from the Valencian region. Valencians, in turn, regard paella as one of their identifying symbols. Heat the olive oil in the paella pan on the prepared grill.
