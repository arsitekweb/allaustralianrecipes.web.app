Heat the silver beet again and add the chickpeas. Silverbeet is very cheap at the moment here in New Zealand. I love how packed it is with NUTRIENTS!!!! Silverbeet will add fibre, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin A, folate and other nutrients to your diet, but an even better reason to eat silver beet is for the lutein it contains. The simplest is to just sweat it in butter or oil or a mix of both.
