This Vegan Cannelloni is a fun recipe to make. Once you make the homemade Marinara Sauce and the Ricotta cheese, the best part is stuffing the Cannelloni with the homemade Ricotta. I find the best way to do this is to take a big scoop of Ricotta cheese on a spoon and carefully stuff the Cannelloni until it is filled the entire way through. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add tomato, water, salt and pepper.
