Broccoli Cheese Rice Casserole is a creamy, cheesy, flavor-filled side dish perfect for holidays on any weeknight dinner. This classic baked green rice casserole is filled with rice, broccoli, and cheese, and water chestnuts add that extra crunch.

This is a good start and mirrors the stuffed pepper filling pretty well. My suggestion though is to use beef broth not water for the soup and rice. Also use ground chicken or turkey with some ground chorizo (beef or pork) combined instead. Somewhat healthier and much more flavor also less grease. This creamy, luscious chicken and wild rice soup is quick and easy to make thanks to pre-cooked rice and rotisserie chicken.
