- "Remove from oven and enjoy. The possibilities are endless! They are great served as a side with roasted chicken, you could toss with your favorite vinaigrette for a roasted veggie salad that can be served warm or cold, use as a pizza topping, add to warmed chicken or veg stock and puree for a wonderful roasted vegetable soup (I like to add a little cream at the end to make it extra yummy and luxurious.), or make them the star ingredient of your next Panini by using your favorite bread (I like Rosemary Focaccia.), provolone cheese, and your favorite spread (I use a delish sundried tomato spread.)."
