I made this up one night when I had leftover pork roast that I had cooked in my slow cooker and frozen. Pork, broccoli and rice with a hint of curry. Rice Milk, Soy Milk and Nut Milk should never be confused with (or used as a replacement for) breast feeding or infant formula, and care should be taken when replacing whole cow milk. These alternative &#34;milks&#34; do not have the right amount of nutrients needed to sustain healthy growth.

A contemporary take on a hearty meal that will make you nostalgic for grandma&#39;s kitchen. Add shallots, leek, carrots, celery, salt and pepper. The chicken needed some flavor so I pan cooked it with light oil with LOTS of garlic. These adjustments worked really well and made a good dish with flavor. Pros: Good ingredients but bland and dry without major adjustments Cons: Not enough rice milk spices salt too much chicken.
