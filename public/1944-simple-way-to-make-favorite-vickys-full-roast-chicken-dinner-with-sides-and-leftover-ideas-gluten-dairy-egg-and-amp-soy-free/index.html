<li>Preheat oven to gas 6 / 200C / 400°F</li>

<li>Season with chicken seasoning and put in the oven. It needs to cook for 40 minutes per kilo</li>

<li>For filo, shortcrust or puff, bake at gas 4 / 180C / 350°F for 25-30 mins or until golden</li>
<li>Make soup! Use any leftover chicken in my Roast Chicken &amp; Rice soup -  - <a href="https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/349824-vickys-roast-chicken-rice-soup-gluten-dairy-egg-soy-nut-free">https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/349824-vickys-roast-chicken-rice-soup-gluten-dairy-egg-soy-nut-free</a></li>

<p>Dark soy, ginger and honey give this chicken noodle soup a fragrant Chinese flavour and pieces of leftover roast chicken are optional (the stock should be potent enough that you don't need it). Sprinkle over spring onions and chilli for a kick and enjoy the combination of crunchy, tangy pickled ginger with the soft. This one-dish roast chicken with vegetables tastes as if it took hours of hands-on time to put together, but the simple ingredients can be prepped in mere minutes. The rosemary gives it a rich flavor, and the meat juices cook the veggies to perfection. It's unbelievably easy! —Sherri Melotik, Oak Creek.</p>
